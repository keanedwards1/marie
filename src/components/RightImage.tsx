                Unity came into being roughly two-hundred years ago, seeded by a
                small band of humans who had a burning desire for peace and oneness. 
                With the assistance of the eleventh-dimensional beings, they brought 
                into form an Earth-like realm and called it Unity.
                <br />
                <br />

                Starting with technologies gifted to them by the extraterrestrials, 
                they built the first crystal grid in the realm and harnessed the power 
                of free energy. With unlimited energy at their fingertips, the 
                firstcomers built a fantastical polycenter. They then proceeded to 
                reach out to all the inhabitants of old Earth, seeking those who were 
                ready to live in oneness, and assisted them with their ascension.
                <br />
                <br />

                The entity called Earth is in a powerful ascension process and an 
                increasing amount of light is pouring onto the planet, slowly 
                awakening the slumbering masses. As more people wake up to their 
                divinity, they stream into the utopian realm. As Unity grows, so too 
                does the power and force of the light that is assisting Earth in her 
                transition. Old Earth, being a planet of duality, is required to 
                always have an equal amount of darkness; thus, under the laws of the 
                universe, those-that-seek-to-control become ever more powerful and 
                diabolical in their destruction of the planet.
                <br />
                <br />

                As the opposing forces intensify, one by one, beings awaken and 
                collapse duality, creating the possibility of choice. Upon awakening, 
                they are no longer bound to Old Earth and are free to stay and assist 
                humanity or leave for a more pleasant realm.
