              trying to navigate a sleeping world, I reveled in the rainstorm of

              Seeking respite in a collapsing world, Rose meditates on a beach
              and is transported to an <em>entirely NEW world.</em> She laughs,
              cries and transforms as she journeys through a magical utopian
              wonderland.
              <br />
              <br />
              Diving deep within, Rose discovers her unique gifts that
              are desperately needed in the land of perfection.

              Her fantastical experience starkly contrasts the dystopian
              hellscape of old Earth, where humans are confronted with the power
              of <em>choice </em>
              and embrace the infinite depths of human compassion.
              <br />

              <br /> The Realm of Unity challenges everything you ever
              thought you knew about yourself and the world in which you live.
              The delightfully spine-tingling conclusion may <em>alter</em> the
              very fabric of your reality.
