Prompt:
I need to update this so that it sends the info to my yet to be created server
(I also need to create the server, and figure out how I'm going to use the info the update the testimonial grid) 

(included the offerings.tsx and TestimonialGrid.tsx)

so far, we've figured out that the site owner needs to sign off on the reviews before they are posted (whether that be automatically via email or manually via me the developer, we haven't decided) I need to understand how difficult it would be to implement this

To update the form to send information to a server and implement a review approval process, you'll need to make several changes to your frontend and create a backend server. Here's an overview of the steps and considerations

Frontend changes:

Update the form submission to use JavaScript:
jsxCopyconst [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  firstName: '',
  lastName: '',
  jobTitle: '',
  review: ''
});

const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/submit-review', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData),
    });
    if (response.ok) {
      // Handle successful submission
      alert('Review submitted successfully!');
    } else {
      // Handle error
      alert('Error submitting review. Please try again.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    alert('An error occurred. Please try again later.');
  }
};

Backend server:

You'll need to create a server (e.g., using Node.js with Express) to handle the form submission. Here's a basic structure:
javascriptCopyconst express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/submit-review', (req, res) => {
  const { firstName, lastName, jobTitle, review } = req.body;
  // Save the review to a database (e.g., MongoDB)
  // Set the review status as 'pending'
  // Send confirmation email to site owner
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Review submitted successfully' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

Review approval process:

There are two main approaches for the approval process:
a. Manual approval:

Store submitted reviews in a database with a 'pending' status.
Create an admin panel where you can view pending reviews and approve/reject them.
Update the TestimonialGrid component to only display approved reviews.

b. Automatic approval via email:

When a review is submitted, send an email to the site owner with the review details and approval/rejection links.
Create API endpoints for approval/rejection that update the review status in the database.
Update the TestimonialGrid component to only display approved reviews.

Implementation difficulty:

Basic form submission to server: Relatively easy
Setting up a backend server: Moderate difficulty
Creating a database to store reviews: Moderate difficulty
Implementing manual approval process: Moderate to high difficulty
Implementing automatic email approval process: High difficulty

The email approval process is more complex because it involves:

Setting up email sending functionality
Generating unique approval/rejection links
Handling email click-through securely
Updating the database based on email actions

My recommendation would be to start with a manual approval process, as it's simpler to implement and gives you more control. You can always add the email approval feature later if needed.
To get started, focus on:

Updating the frontend form to submit data to your server
Creating a basic backend server to receive and store the data
Implementing a simple admin panel to view and approve/reject reviews
Updating the TestimonialGrid to display only approved reviews

Would you like me to provide more detailed code examples for any specific part of this process?
